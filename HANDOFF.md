## Read-first constraints

Read `AGENTS.md`, the Software Factory guide, planning DOCX/TXT, frozen UI manifest,
W8 contract, current task list, evidence and source before writing. AAVC remains
read-only. UI-001..042 frozen. All canonical mutations require CommandBus; no
presentation-to-infrastructure shortcuts. One serial W8 task per continuation.

## W8 accepted progress

- W8-001 canonical deterministic validation: PASS.
- W8-002 real media integrity + frozen UI-041 validation projection: PASS.
- W8-003 verified single asset relink: PASS.
- W8-004 batch directory relink scan + candidate ranking: PASS.
- W8-005 autosave catalog + retention hardening: PASS.
- W8-006 crash marker + explicit startup recovery: PASS.

## W8-003 qualification

- validated manual single-asset relink through canonical CommandBatch / CommandBus;
- exact Asset ID and clip references preserved;
- wrong media type, fingerprint, duration, dimensions and audio metadata fail safely with zero mutation;
- path already owned by another asset is rejected;
- missing source -> renamed relocated media -> verified rebind -> validation clears;
- one revision on apply, exact Undo and Redo, exact .angproj save/reopen;
- no batch scan, ranking, recovery flow or frozen UI redesign in W8-003;
- targeted tests **9/9 PASS**, full pytest **411/411 PASS**;
- real-media evidence verifier **23/23 PASS**;
- Windows CI lint, mypy, architecture, source-of-truth, secret and UI 42/42 gates PASS;
- full main-HEAD regression **27/27 workflow families SUCCESS**, all attempt 1.

**Dedicated Windows workflow:** [37721840504](https://github.com/inoriko920-dev/AI-Ngerti-Geopolitik/actions/runs/37721840504) — SUCCESS  
**Artifact:** `ANG-S11-W8-004-Batch-Directory-Relink`, ID `11525753140`  
**Artifact SHA-256:** `75f33b72c4cf147d37b151e17bb7ae6bddc84982941f9f0aa8847c97d4fe4fb4`  
**Tests:** targeted 9/9 PASS; full pytest 420/420 PASS; real-media evidence 14/14 PASS  
**Gates:** Ruff, mypy (75 modules), import contracts, architecture, no-secret, source-of-truth 70/70, UI SHA 42/42 PASS

Verified: bounded worker scan, cancellation, stale project/session/revision/hash safety,
rank 1–4, SHA-256 verified explicit selection only, ambiguous candidate review,
one atomic CommandBatch, stable asset/clip IDs, exact Undo/Redo, save/reopen and
real-media validation. UI-040 projects intents; controller wiring remains W8-010.

- New and legacy autosave filename compatibility, deterministic timestamp ordering, validated per-project catalog, maximum **20** managed valid snapshots, corrupt/foreign isolation and write/unlink failure guards qualified.
- Source `.angproj` and `.bak` are never retention/prune targets; source bytes unchanged in evidence. UI-039 recovery is deferred to W8-006.

## W8-006 accepted evidence

- Accepted W8-006 implementation and same-HEAD regression commit: `5a975bb312714f84315b9b752deac75a33021fab`.
- [Dedicated Windows recovery workflow](https://github.com/inoriko920-dev/AI-Ngerti-Geopolitik/actions/runs/37726261665): **SUCCESS**.
- Artifact: `ANG-S11-W8-006-Crash-Recovery`, ID `11528226010`,
  ZIP SHA-256 `adc9591b108a82f2b4e09d7f7bc3714133a6dd7ec839ed2216e7568351ad1165`.

- Same-HEAD regression **27/27 workflow families SUCCESS, attempt 1**,
  including Windows portable foundation, UI shell, timeline, E2E, subtitle,
  media and previous W8 qualification.
- Proven: clean/unclean marker, valid newer-only snapshots, corrupt-newest
  isolation, explicit Open Source / Recover Snapshot / Ignore choices,
  stale snapshot/source rejection, exact project source bytes unchanged
  during recovery, dirty working state until explicit Save, clean-close guard.
- UI-039 intent/projection qualification only; complete main-window wiring
  remains W8-010. W8-007 persistence-failure injection is a separate next STEP.

## Next exact action

On owner's explicit **lanjutkan**, execute **SOL S11-W8-007 only** using the
locked ASTRA W8 planning. Inject failures around atomic persistence
temp/write/replace, protect existing source bytes, verify retry behavior.
Do not automatically rewrite JsonProjectRepository unless tests prove a defect.
W8-008 remains blocked. Do not implement W8-008 in the same turn.

## Provisional gates

W5 microphone physical hardware and W6/W7 live Gemini network tests remain
provisional; do not claim device/provider smoke results that were not run.


## W8-007 active implementation (QA gate pending)

W8-007 inspected existing `JsonProjectRepository._write` and found a real
untracked temporary-file leak if payload write/flush/fsync fails. The existing
atomic serializer is retained; remediation registers the temporary file as
soon as it is opened and ensures owned temporary files are cleaned after
failure. Failure stages are typed as `PersistenceError` in the application
layer with a safe, actionable Indonesian projection. No source/schema/history
changes or UI redesign. Tests inject temp/write/sync/backup-copy/backup-replace/
source-replace faults, check exact source hash, backup validity, session dirty
state, Save As and retry. Dedicated Windows workflow W8-007 exists.

**Gate: IN_VERIFICATION (not PASS).** Evidence source:
`docs/evidence/features/S11_W8_007_ATOMIC_PERSISTENCE.md`.
Do not start W8-008 until W8-007 has a verified same-HEAD regression.
